## Functional CHIP-8 Interpreter

I had lot of fun with developing this interpreter.
Although I did not implement everything I wanted,
I can say this project is functional and closed.
Should be easy to build with provided CMake. Enjoy!

working towards functional application, currently:
 - opcodes mostly provided                      ✔️
 - input provided                               ✔️
 - graphic interface provided by raylib (❤️)    ✔️

todo in the future maybe:
 - fix opcodes :/                               ✔️
 - better interface                             ❌
 - better code structure                        ✔️
 - exe release                                  ❌
 - configurable application                     ❌
 - super opcodes (?)                            ❌
 - hardware port (?)                            ❌
 - function pointers instead of switch statement✔️
 - improve graphics (filters - Hqx)             ❌

Not everything from the list is implemented, but app is working fine.
